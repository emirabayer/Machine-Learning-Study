## PCA for Cat-Dog Image Morphing
This project involves the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), focusing on dimensionality reduction and image morphing. The project processes a dataset of 4000 grayscale cat and dog images (60x60 pixels) using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compute the first 10 principal components, calculate their Proportion of Variance Explained (PVE), and visualize them as eigenfaces. Additionally, it performs face morphing between a cat and a dog image by interpolating their projections in eigenspace, generating intermediate images for t values from 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments. The code, written in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib, demonstrates proficiency in linear algebra, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques.
